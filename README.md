Linear Regression analysis of housing prices in King County Washington

We will use the King County House Sales dataset:
House Sales Prediction (Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

Contains information on 21,613 house sales in King County, Washington (includes Seattle).
Features include:
Square footage of living space and lot
Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
Floors, waterfront view, condition, grade
Year built and year renovated
Geographic location (latitude, longitude, zip code)
Target variable: Sale Price
Project Goal

Build regression models to predict housing prices based on property features.
Compare Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
Evaluate models using metrics:
R² (variance explained)
MAE (mean absolute error)
RMSE (root mean squared error)
Why This Matters

Housing prices are influenced by many factors: size, location, condition, and more.
Regression helps us quantify relationships and make predictions.
This project connects data science techniques to a real-world problem in economics and urban planning.
Deliverables

Data Exploration
Summary statistics, distributions, correlations.
Model Building
Fit Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression models.
Model Evaluation
Report R², MAE, RMSE for each model.
Interpret coefficients (which features matter most).
Reflection
Discuss overfitting, regularization, and practical insights.
Key Takeaway

By the end of this project, you will:

Understand how regression applies to real-world housing data.
Gain hands-on experience with model building and evaluation.
Be able to explain trade-offs between different regression approaches.
